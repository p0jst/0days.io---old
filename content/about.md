Thank you for accidentally stumbling upon this website, I am happy you are here.

My name is Frederik and I am working as a cyber security consultant. I take big pride in my work, and when I have a chance I also document it.

When you are working as a cyber security consultant, you hear a lot of people talk about expensive and unmanageable software that *'makes our organization so much safer'*. I do not believe that is the case. I believe people, and working with people is the key element for proper cyber security in an organization.

What is a big expensive wall going to do, if your colleagues open the door for the attacker? A wise old Kevin Mitnick once said: *"You cannot download a patch for human stupidity"*.
